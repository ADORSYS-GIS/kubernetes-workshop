# 01 - Introduction to Kubernetes

Welcome to the Kubernetes Universe! This section introduces the fundamental concepts and architecture of Kubernetes.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- What Kubernetes is and why it matters
- Container orchestration fundamentals  
- The difference between containers and virtual machines
- Key Kubernetes concepts and terminology
- When to use Kubernetes vs. other solutions

## 📖 Topics Covered

### 1. Container Technology Foundation
- **Namespaces**: Process isolation and security boundaries
- **Cgroups**: Resource management and limits
- **Union Filesystems**: Layered image architecture
- **Container Runtimes**: Docker, containerd, CRI-O comparison

### 2. The Orchestration Challenge  
- **Manual container management**: Scaling limitations
- **Service discovery**: Finding and connecting services
- **Load balancing**: Distributing traffic efficiently
- **Self-healing**: Automatic failure recovery
- **Rolling updates**: Zero-downtime deployments

### 3. Kubernetes Overview
- **Declarative configuration**: Desired state management
- **API-driven architecture**: Everything as code
- **Extensible platform**: Custom resources and operators
- **Multi-cloud portability**: Consistent experience across providers

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Container vs. VM Comparison
| Aspect | Containers | Virtual Machines |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Resource Usage** | Lightweight | Heavy |
| **Startup Time** | Seconds | Minutes |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | Hardware-level |
| **Portability** | Excellent | Limited |
| **Security** | Shared kernel | Full isolation |

### Why Kubernetes?
- **Scalability**: Handle thousands of containers across hundreds of nodes
- **Reliability**: Built-in redundancy and self-healing capabilities  
- **Efficiency**: Optimal resource utilization and bin-packing
- **Velocity**: Faster development and deployment cycles
- **Standardization**: Industry-standard container orchestration

## 📋 Prerequisites Check

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- [ ] Basic understanding of containers (Docker experience helpful)
- [ ] Command line familiarity (Terminal/PowerShell)
- [ ] Text editor installed (VS Code, vim, etc.)
- [ ] Internet connection for downloading tools and images
